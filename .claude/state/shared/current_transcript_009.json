This is controlled via the `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` environment variable. Understanding this feature requires tracing the complete startup flow from container launch through settings application.\n    53→\n    54→**Container Initialization and Script Architecture:**\n    55→\n    56→When the Docker container starts, the entry point is `/home/ibgateway/scripts/run.sh` (defined in Dockerfile CMD at line 107). This is the orchestrator script that sets up the complete environment. The script sources `/home/ibgateway/scripts/common.sh` at line 12, which provides all shared functions used across the initialization process. The `common.sh` file is critical because it contains the vulnerable code we need to fix - specifically the `apply_settings()` function.\n    57→\n    58→The container runs as user `ibgateway` (UID 1000 by default, configurable via USER_ID build arg) in a non-root security context. The home directory is `/home/ibgateway` and the default TWS installation path is `/home/ibgateway/Jts` (set as `TWS_PATH` environment variable in Dockerfile line 76).\n    59→\n    60→**Settings Path Configuration Flow (apply_settings function in common.sh:6-41):**\n    61→\n    62→The `apply_settings()` function is called early in the startup sequence (from run.sh line 103, within the `start_process()` function). This function's job is to:\n    63→\n    64→1. Apply environment variables to IBC config files (IB Controller - the automation tool that logs into TWS/Gateway)\n    65→2. Determine where TWS should store its settings files\n    66→3. Create the settings directory if it doesn't exist (THIS IS WHERE THE VULNERABILITY LIVES)\n    67→4. Set up the jts.ini configuration file with timezone settings\n    68→\n    69→Here's the detailed flow when a user provides `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH`:\n    70→\n    71→**Step 1 - Environment Variable Handling (lines 8-16):**\n    72→\n    73→The function first checks if `CUSTOM_CONFIG != yes`. If users are providing their own config files, this function exits early and doesn't touch anything. Assuming normal operation, it proceeds to handle the TWS password using the `file_env` pattern.\n    74→\n    75→The `file_env` function (defined at common.sh:47-63) is a security pattern that supports Docker secrets. It checks for both `TWS_PASSWORD` and `TWS_PASSWORD_FILE`, loads the password from the appropriate source, exports it as an environment variable, then uses `envsubst` to replace placeholders in the IBC config template. After substitution, the password is immediately unset via `unset_env` to prevent credential leakage. The resulting config file is chmod 600 to ensure only the container user can read it.\n    76→\n    77→**Step 2 - Settings Directory Determination (lines 18-30):**\n    78→\n    79→This is the critical section containing the vulnerability. The logic flow is:\n    80→\n    81→```bash\n    82→if [ -n \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" ]; then\n    83→    echo \".> Settings directory set to: $TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n    84→    _JTS_PATH=$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\n    85→    if [ ! -d \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" ]; then\n    86→        # if TWS_SETTINGS_PATH does not exists, create it\n    87→        echo \".> Creating directory: $TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n    88→        mkdir \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"  # LINE 25 - VULNERABLE\n    89→    fi\n    90→else\n    91→    echo \".> Settings directory NOT set, defaulting to: $TWS_PATH\"\n    92→    _JTS_PATH=$TWS_PATH\n    93→fi\n    94→```\n    95→\n    96→When `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` is provided by the user (via docker-compose.yml environment variables), the code:\n    97→- Sets an internal variable `_JTS_PATH` to this user-provided path\n    98→- Checks if the directory exists with `[ ! -d \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" ]`\n    99→- If it doesn't exist, calls `mkdir \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"` WITHOUT ANY VALIDATION\n   100→\n   101→**THE VULNERABILITY - Path Traversal (CWE-22):**\n   102→\n   103→The `mkdir` command at line 25 (and identical lines in latest/common.sh:25 and image-files/common.sh:25) accepts the user-provided path without validating that it doesn't contain path traversal sequences like `..` (parent directory references).\n   104→\n   105→Attack scenarios:\n   106→```bash\n   107→# Scenario 1: Escape container home directory\n   108→TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=\"/home/ibgateway/../../tmp/malicious\"\n   109→# mkdir creates: /tmp/malicious (outside intended /home/ibgateway scope)\n   110→\n   111→# Scenario 2: Target system directories\n   112→TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=\"/home/ibgateway/../../../etc/pwned\"\n   113→# mkdir attempts: /etc/pwned (will fail due to permissions, but demonstrates vulnerability)\n   114→\n   115→# Scenario 3: Overwrite existing paths\n   116→TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=\"/home/ibgateway/Jts/../.ssh\"\n   117→# Resolves to: /home/ibgateway/.ssh (could interfere with SSH keys)\n   118→```\n   119→\n   120→While the container runs as non-root (UID 1000), limiting damage potential, successful path traversal could:\n   121→- Create directories in unintended locations within the user's writable space\n   122→- Interfere with other container functionality (SSH keys, IBC configs, TWS installation)\n   123→- Confuse volume mounts if the traversed path happens to overlap with mount points\n   124→- Violate principle of least privilege and defense-in-depth\n   125→\n   126→**Step 3 - jts.ini Configuration (lines 31-37):**\n   127→\n   128→After determining the settings path, the function checks if `jts.ini` already exists in the target directory. The `jts.ini` file controls TWS timezone settings and other runtime configuration. If the file doesn't exist (first run or fresh settings directory), the script uses `envsubst` to populate it from a template (`/home/ibgateway/Jts/jts.ini.tmpl`), replacing `${TIME_ZONE}` with the user's configured timezone.\n   129→\n   130→This is why `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` is important for persistent settings - if you mount a volume here, your `jts.ini` customizations survive container restarts. Without validation, however, an attacker could potentially create this file in unintended locations.\n   131→\n   132→**Integration with IBC (IB Controller):**\n   133→\n   134→The `_JTS_PATH` variable set by this function is later passed to IBC (the automation tool) when starting the gateway. The IBC start command (in run.sh:88-92) includes:\n   135→\n   136→```bash\n   137→\"${IBC_PATH}/scripts/ibcstart.sh\" \"${TWS_MAJOR_VRSN}\" -g \\\n   138→    \"--tws-path=${TWS_PATH}\" \\\n   139→    \"--ibc-path=${IBC_PATH}\" \"--ibc-ini=${IBC_INI}\" \\\n   140→    \"--on2fatimeout=${TWOFA_TIMEOUT_ACTION}\" \\\n   141→    \"--tws-settings-path=${TWS_SETTINGS_PATH:-}\"\n   142→```\n   143→\n   144→The `--tws-settings-path` parameter tells IBC where to find TWS configuration files. If an attacker has traversed to an arbitrary path, IBC will look for settings there, potentially causing runtime failures or unexpected behavior.\n   145→\n   146→**Dual Mode Complexity (TRADING_MODE=both):**\n   147→\n   148→The situation becomes more complex when `TRADING_MODE=both` is used (runs both live and paper trading instances simultaneously). In this case (run.sh:139-148), the code modifies `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` by appending `_live` and `_paper` suffixes:\n   149→\n   150→```bash\n   151→if [ -n \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" ]; then\n   152→    _TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=\"${TWS_SETTINGS_PATH}\"\n   153→    export _TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\n   154→    TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=\"${_TWS_SETTINGS_PATH}_${TRADING_MODE}\"\n   155→fi\n   156→```\n   157→\n   158→This means if a user sets `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=/config/settings`, the code creates:\n   159→- `/config/settings_live` (for live trading)\n   160→- `/config/settings_paper` (for paper trading)\n   161→\n   162→**Critical insight**: The path traversal vulnerability affects BOTH paths in dual mode. An attacker could use:\n   163→```bash\n   164→TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=\"/home/ibgateway/../tmp/evil\"\n   165→# Results in mkdir for:\n   166→#   /tmp/evil_live\n   167→#   /tmp/evil_paper\n   168→```\n   169→\n   170→**Typical User Configuration:**\n   171→\n   172→From the README.md and docker-compose.yml examples, typical legitimate usage looks like:\n   173→\n   174→```yaml\n   175→environment:\n   176→  TWS_SETTINGS_PATH: /home/ibgateway/Jts  # For IB Gateway\n   177→  # OR\n   178→  TWS_SETTINGS_PATH: /config/tws_settings  # For TWS image\n   179→volumes:\n   180→  - ./tws_settings:/home/ibgateway/Jts\n   181→  # OR\n   182→  - ./config:/config\n   183→```\n   184→\n   185→Users mount a host directory to persist settings across container restarts. The environment variable tells the container where that mount point is. The README (lines 287-310) specifically recommends this pattern for preserving IB Gateway configuration.\n   186→\n   187→**Why This Matters - Defense in Depth:**\n   188→\n   189→Even though the container is non-root, path traversal violations are a security anti-pattern because:\n   190→\n   191→1. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Users expect paths to be validated and contained\n   192→2. **Future-proofing**: Container permissions might change, image might be run in different contexts\n   193→3. **CWE-22 Compliance**: Industry-standard security frameworks classify path traversal as a vulnerability regardless of impact severity\n   194→4. **Recent Security Focus**: This codebase recently fixed CWE-78 (command injection in SSH) and added strict error handling. Path validation fits this security hardening trend.\n   195→5. **Audit Requirements**: Financial trading platforms (IB Gateway's use case) often face compliance audits that flag path traversal issues\n   196→\n   197→**Error Handling Context:**\n   198→\n   199→A recent fix (commit 48322ac) added strict error handling to common.sh by ensuring `set -Eeo pipefail` is active at line 4. This means:\n   200→- `set -e`: Exit immediately if any command fails\n   201→- `set -E`: ERR trap is inherited by shell functions\n   202→- `set -o pipefail`: Pipelines fail if any command in the pipe fails\n   203→\n   204→This fail-fast behavior is critical for security. If the mkdir command fails (wrong permissions, disk full, etc.), the entire container startup aborts rather than silently continuing with broken configuration. Our fix should maintain this behavior - validation should exit with error code 1 on invalid input, causing the container to stop.\n   205→\n   206→### What Needs to Connect: Path Validation Implementation\n   207→\n   208→**The Fix - Add Validation Before mkdir:**\n   209→\n   210→We need to add validation that rejects paths containing `..` before the mkdir operation at line 25 (and equivalents in latest/ and image-files/). The validation should:\n   211→\n   212→1. Check if `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` contains the literal string `..`\n   213→2. Display a clear, actionable error message\n   214→3. Exit with code 1 to halt container startup (leveraging existing `set -e` behavior)\n   215→4. Preserve all existing functionality for valid paths\n   216→\n   217→**Security Pattern to Follow:**\n   218→\n   219→The codebase has established patterns for validation. Looking at common.sh:75-114, we see the `set_ports()` function validates `TRADING_MODE` values:\n   220→\n   221→```bash\n   222→if [ \"$TRADING_MODE\" = \"paper\" ]; then\n   223→    # valid - set paper ports\n   224→elif [ \"$TRADING_MODE\" = \"live\" ]; then\n   225→    # valid - set live ports\n   226→else\n   227→    # invalid option\n   228→    echo \".> Invalid TRADING_MODE: $TRADING_MODE\"\n   229→    exit 1\n   230→fi\n   231→```\n   232→\n   233→We should follow the same pattern: test for invalid input, echo an error message prefixed with `.>` (the established logging convention), and exit 1.\n   234→\n   235→**Error Message Design:**\n   236→\n   237→The error message should:\n   238→- Be clear about what's wrong (\"contains invalid path traversal\")\n   239→- Help users fix it (implicit - they'll see the .. in their path and remove it)\n   240→- Match the existing message style (`.>` prefix, concise, informative)\n   241→\n   242→Example from the task recommendation:\n   243→```bash\n   244→if [[ \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" =~ \\.\\. ]]; then\n   245→    echo \".> Error: TWS_SETTINGS_PATH contains invalid path traversal\"\n   246→    exit 1\n   247→fi\n   248→```\n   249→\n   250→This uses bash's `=~` regex operator to match the literal string `..` anywhere in the path. The `[[` double-bracket test is preferred over `[` because it doesn't require quoting the regex and has better error handling.\n   251→\n   252→**Defensive mkdir Flag:**\n   253→\n   254→The task also recommends adding `-p` flag to mkdir. This is a defense-in-depth measure:\n   255→\n   256→```bash\n   257→mkdir -p \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n   258→```\n   259→\n   260→The `-p` flag:\n   261→- Creates parent directories if they don't exist (defensive - handles paths like `/home/ibgateway/custom/settings`)\n   262→- Succeeds silently if the directory already exists (idempotent behavior)\n   263→- Is a standard practice in initialization scripts\n   264→\n   265→However, it's important to note this does NOT prevent path traversal - it just makes mkdir more robust. The validation check is still required.\n   266→\n   267→**Why Validation BEFORE mkdir:**\n   268→\n   269→The check must happen BEFORE the mkdir call, not after:\n   270→\n   271→```bash\n   272→# CORRECT ORDER:\n   273→if [[ \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" =~ \\.\\. ]]; then\n   274→    echo \".> Error: TWS_SETTINGS_PATH contains invalid path traversal\"\n   275→    exit 1\n   276→fi\n   277→mkdir -p \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n   278→\n   279→# WRONG - mkdir happens before check (too late):\n   280→mkdir -p \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n   281→if [[ \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" =~ \\.\\. ]]; then\n   282→    # Directory already created!\n   283→```\n   284→\n   285→This ensures we never execute the dangerous operation on invalid input.\n   286→\n   287→**Insertion Point:**\n   288→\n   289→The validation should be inserted in the apply_settings function immediately after the \"Settings directory set to\" log line and before the directory existence check. The logical flow becomes:\n   290→\n   291→```bash\n   292→if [ -n \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" ]; then\n   293→    echo \".> Settings directory set to: $TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n   294→\n   295→    # NEW: Validation block\n   296→    if [[ \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" =~ \\.\\. ]]; then\n   297→        echo \".> Error: TWS_SETTINGS_PATH contains invalid path traversal\"\n   298→        exit 1\n   299→    fi\n   300→\n   301→    _JTS_PATH=$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\n   302→    if [ ! -d \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\" ]; then\n   303→        echo \".> Creating directory: $TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n   304→        mkdir -p \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"  # Added -p flag\n   305→    fi\n   306→```\n   307→\n   308→This placement ensures:\n   309→- User sees their configured path in the log before validation fails (helpful for debugging)\n   310→- Validation happens before any filesystem operations\n   311→- The variable assignment to `_JTS_PATH` only happens for valid paths\n   312→- Existing logic flow is minimally disrupted\n   313→\n   314→**Impact on Dual Mode:**\n   315→\n   316→In dual mode (TRADING_MODE=both), the validation will run twice:\n   317→1. First call to `start_process()` for live mode (TWS_SETTINGS_PATH with `_live` suffix)\n   318→2.
