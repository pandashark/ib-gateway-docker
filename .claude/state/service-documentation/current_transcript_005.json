This feature allows users to remotely view and interact with the IB Gateway GUI through a VNC client. VNC is **only available for the ib-gateway image** - the TWS (Trader Workstation) image uses RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) instead for remote GUI access.\n\n**The Critical Security Issue:**\n\nCurrently, when the VNC server starts, the password is passed directly on the x11vnc command line using the `-passwd` option. This makes the password visible to any user on the system via `ps aux`, `/proc` filesystem, or process monitoring tools. This is a credential exposure vulnerability that violates security best practices for secret handling.\n\n**Architectural Context - How the Container Starts:**\n\nWhen the IB Gateway Docker container launches, it follows this orchestrated startup sequence (all managed by `/home/ibgateway/scripts/run.sh`):\n\n1. **Error handling setup** (line 5): `set -Eeo pipefail` - Strict bash error handling\n2. **Source common library** (line 12): `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"` - Loads shared functions\n3. **Define cleanup handler** (lines 14-45): `stop_ibc()` function - Handles SIGINT/SIGTERM for graceful shutdown\n4. **Start Xvfb** (line 104): `start_xvfb()` - Launches X11 virtual framebuffer (display :1)\n5. **Setup SSH** (line 107): `setup_ssh()` - Configures SSH tunnel if SSH_TUNNEL is enabled\n6. **Set Java heap** (line 110): `set_java_heap()` - Configures JVM memory settings\n7. **Start VNC server** (line 113): `start_vnc()` - **THIS IS WHERE THE VULNERABILITY EXISTS**\n8. **Start IB Gateway** (line 141+): `start_process()` → `start_IBC()` - Launches the actual IB Gateway application\n9. **Trap signals** (line 171): `trap stop_ibc SIGINT SIGTERM` - Register cleanup on container stop\n10. **Wait forever** (line 172): `wait \"${pid[@]}\"` - Block until IB Gateway process exits\n\n**The Vulnerable start_vnc() Function (run.sh:56-66):**\n\n```bash\nstart_vnc() {\n\t# start VNC server\n\tfile_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\tif [ -n \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" ]; then\n\t\techo \".> Starting VNC server\"\n\t\tx11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" &\n\t\tunset_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\telse\n\t\techo \".> VNC server disabled\"\n\tfi\n}\n```\n\n**Line-by-Line Breakdown of Current Implementation:**\n\n1. **Line 58: `file_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'`**\n   - This calls the `file_env()` function from `common.sh` (lines 47-63)\n   - Implements Docker secrets support: checks for both `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD` and `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD_FILE`\n   - If `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD_FILE` is set, reads the password from that file (e.g., `/run/secrets/vnc_password`)\n   - If `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD` is set directly, uses that value\n   - If both are set, exits with error (mutual exclusivity validation)\n   - After execution, `$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD` contains the password in memory\n\n2. **Line 59: `if [ -n \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" ]; then`**\n   - Checks if a password was provided (either directly or via file)\n   - If empty/unset, VNC is completely disabled (secure default)\n\n3. **Line 61: `x11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" &`**\n   - **THE VULNERABILITY**: `-passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\"` exposes the password\n   - `x11vnc` - The VNC server executable (installed via apt in Dockerfile line 93)\n   - `-ncache_cr` - Client-side caching for better performance\n   - `-display :1` - Connect to Xvfb display :1 (started earlier by start_xvfb())\n   - `-forever` - Keep accepting connections (don't exit after first client disconnects)\n   - `-shared` - Allow multiple VNC clients to connect simultaneously\n   - `-bg` - Run in background (daemonize)\n   - `-noipv6` - Disable IPv6 (bind only to IPv4)\n   - `-passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\"` - **VULNERABLE**: Password in command line\n   - `&` - Run in background, allowing script to continue\n\n4. **Line 62: `unset_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'`**\n   - Calls `unset_env()` from `common.sh` (lines 67-73)\n   - If password came from a file (`VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD_FILE`), unset the variable\n   - Security measure to clear password from environment after use\n   - NOTE: This happens AFTER x11vnc is launched, so password is already exposed in process list\n\n**Why This Is a Vulnerability:**\n\nWhen x11vnc launches with `-passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\"`, the operating system records the full command line in several places:\n\n1. **Process table** (`ps aux`, `ps -ef`):\n   ```bash\n   ibgateway  1234  ... x11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwd MySecretPassword &\n   ```\n   Any user on the system can see this.\n\n2. **/proc filesystem** (`/proc/1234/cmdline`):\n   The full command line is readable by any user, even after the process starts.\n\n3. **Process monitoring tools**:\n   Tools like `top`, `htop`, `pstree -a`, container monitoring systems, log aggregators that capture process launches.\n\n4. **Audit logs** (if enabled):\n   Some systems log all command executions, permanently recording the password.\n\n**Attack Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Multi-tenant Docker host**: Other containers on the same host could read the process list\n2. **Shared hosting**: Multiple users with shell access to the same Docker host\n3. **Compromised monitoring**: If monitoring/logging systems are compromised, historical password data is exposed\n4. **Container escape**: If an attacker gains access inside the container, they can see the VNC password for lateral movement\n5. **Accidental disclosure**: Process listings in logs, screenshots, or troubleshooting sessions expose the credential\n\n**Why This Matters for IB Gateway:**\n\nWhile VNC itself is only for development/maintenance (not the trading API), it provides full GUI access to IB Gateway. An attacker with VNC access can:\n- View account balances and positions\n- Place unauthorized trades (if not using read-only API mode)\n- Modify IB Gateway configuration\n- Access IBC configuration files containing additional credentials\n- Use the compromised container as a pivot point for further attacks\n\n**The Correct Solution: Using -passwdfile Instead:**\n\nThe x11vnc tool provides a `-passwdfile` option specifically designed to avoid command-line password exposure. The secure implementation:\n\n```bash\nstart_vnc() {\n\t# start VNC server\n\tfile_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\tif [ -n \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" ]; then\n\t\techo \".> Starting VNC server\"\n\n\t\t# Create secure temporary file for password (using $$ for unique PID-based naming)\n\t\t_vnc_pass_file=\"/tmp/.vncpass.$$\"\n\t\techo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n\t\tchmod 600 \"$_vnc_pass_file\"  # Read/write for owner only\n\n\t\t# Launch x11vnc with password from file instead of command line\n\t\tx11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwdfile \"$_vnc_pass_file\" &\n\n\t\t# Give x11vnc time to read the password file before we delete it\n\t\tsleep 1\n\n\t\t# Clean up the temporary password file\n\t\trm -f \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n\n\t\tunset_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\telse\n\t\techo \".> VNC server disabled\"\n\tfi\n}\n```\n\n**Why This Fix Works:**\n\n1. **Temporary file**: Password is written to `/tmp/.vncpass.$$` where `$$` is the shell's process ID, ensuring uniqueness\n2. **Secure permissions**: `chmod 600` makes the file readable only by the container user (ibgateway)\n3. **No command-line exposure**: The process list shows `-passwdfile /tmp/.vncpass.1234`, not the actual password\n4. **Ephemeral**: File is deleted after x11vnc reads it (typically during startup)\n5. **Timing**: The `sleep 1` ensures x11vnc (running with `-bg` in background) has time to read the file before deletion\n6. **Clean process list**: `ps aux` shows: `x11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwdfile /tmp/.vncpass.1234`\n\n**How x11vnc -passwdfile Works:**\n\nWhen x11vnc starts with `-passwdfile`:\n1. x11vnc reads the specified file immediately during initialization\n2. The password is loaded into x11vnc's internal memory\n3. x11vnc doesn't need the file to exist after startup\n4. Even if the file is deleted, x11vnc continues running with the password in memory\n5. The password never appears in the process command line\n\n**Alternative Approaches Considered:**\n\n**Option 1: Using stdin (REJECTED)**\n```bash\necho \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" | x11vnc ... -passwdfile stdin\n```\n- **Problem**: x11vnc's `-passwdfile stdin` is not well-supported in background mode (`-bg`)\n- **Problem**: The `echo` command itself might be visible in process list momentarily\n\n**Option 2: Using environment variable passthrough (REJECTED)**\n```bash\nVNC_PASSWORD=\"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" x11vnc ...\n```\n- **Problem**: x11vnc doesn't support reading password from a custom environment variable\n- **Problem**: Environment variables are also visible in `/proc/[pid]/environ`\n\n**Option 3: Named pipe (OVERLY COMPLEX)**\n```bash\nmkfifo /tmp/vnc_pipe\nx11vnc -passwdfile /tmp/vnc_pipe &\necho \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > /tmp/vnc_pipe\n```\n- **Problem**: Complexity for no security benefit over temporary file\n- **Problem**: Potential race conditions and deadlocks\n\n**Chosen: Temporary file with immediate deletion (BEST)**\n- Simple, standard approach\n- Well-supported by x11vnc\n- Minimal window of exposure (1 second)\n- Process list completely clean\n\n**Comparison with Existing Credential Handling Patterns:**\n\nThis codebase already handles credentials securely in other places. Let's look at the established pattern in `apply_settings()` from `common.sh`:\n\n```bash\napply_settings() {\n\t# Line 11: Use TWS_PASSWORD in template substitution\n\tfile_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'\n\tenvsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"\n\tunset_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'\n\t# Line 16: Secure the file containing credentials\n\tchmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n**The pattern:**\n1. Load credential with `file_env()` (supports Docker secrets)\n2. Write to a file during configuration\n3. Immediately `chmod 600` to restrict access\n4. Clear from environment with `unset_env()`\n\n**Our VNC fix follows the same security philosophy:**\n1. Load credential with `file_env()` ✓ (already done)\n2. Write to a temporary file ✓ (new: temporary password file)\n3. Secure the file with `chmod 600` ✓ (new)\n4. Use the file instead of command-line argument ✓ (new: -passwdfile)\n5. Delete the temporary file ✓ (new: rm after x11vnc reads it)\n6. Clear from environment with `unset_env()` ✓ (already done)\n\n**Error Handling and Edge Cases:**\n\nThe current implementation uses `set -Eeo pipefail` (line 5 of run.sh), which means any command failure will halt the script. However, there are some edge cases to consider:\n\n**Edge Case 1: What if x11vnc fails to start?**\n\nCurrent code:\n```bash\nx11vnc ... -passwdfile \"$_vnc_pass_file\" &\nsleep 1\nrm -f \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n```\n\nIf x11vnc fails immediately (bad options, display :1 not available, etc.), the `&` backgrounds it, so the script continues. The `sleep 1` ensures we don't delete the file before x11vnc tries to read it. The `rm -f` uses `-f` flag, so it won't fail if the file is already gone.\n\n**Analysis**: The current error handling is adequate because:\n- If x11vnc fails, the container will still start (VNC is optional)\n- The password file gets cleaned up regardless\n- Users will notice VNC isn't working and can check logs\n\n**Edge Case 2: What if /tmp is not writable?**\n\nIf `/tmp` is not writable, the `echo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\"` will fail. With `set -e` enabled, this will halt the container startup.\n\n**Analysis**: This is correct behavior because:\n- If `/tmp` is not writable, the container is misconfigured\n- It's better to fail loudly than start in a broken state\n- This follows the \"fail fast\" principle\n\n**Edge Case 3: What if file creation succeeds but chmod fails?**\n\nIf `chmod 600` fails (which is extremely rare), the password file exists with default permissions (likely 644, world-readable).\n\n**Analysis**: With `set -e`, the script will halt if `chmod` fails, preventing x11vnc from starting with an insecurely-permissioned password file. This is the correct behavior.\n\n**Edge Case 4: Race condition - could another process read the file?**\n\nBetween file creation and `chmod 600`, there's a microsecond window where the file might have default permissions.\n\n**Mitigation**: Use `umask` before file creation:\n```bash\n(umask 077; echo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\")\n```\n\nHowever, this is likely overkill for a single-user container context where:\n- The container runs as a non-root user (ibgateway, UID 1000)\n- There are no other users in the container\n- `/tmp` is not shared with the host by default\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep it simple with current approach. The `chmod 600` immediately after file creation is sufficient.\n\n**Edge Case 5: What if x11vnc doesn't finish reading the file before rm?**\n\nThe `sleep 1` provides x11vnc time to:\n1. Daemonize (due to `-bg` flag)\n2. Open the password file\n3. Read the password\n4. Close the file\n\nOne second is more than sufficient. x11vnc reads the password file synchronously during startup, typically in milliseconds. The `-bg` backgrounding happens after password validation.\n\n**Testing Approach: How to Verify the Fix**\n\nAfter applying the fix, verification requires:\n\n**Test 1: Password not visible in process list**\n```bash\n# Inside the container\ndocker exec -it ib-gateway bash\nps aux | grep x11vnc\n# Should show: -passwdfile /tmp/.vncpass.[PID]\n# Should NOT show: -passwd [actual password]\n```\n\n**Test 2: VNC connection still works**\n```bash\n# From client machine\nvncviewer localhost:5900\n# Enter the VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\n# Should successfully connect to IB Gateway GUI\n```\n\n**Test 3: Temporary file is cleaned up**\n```bash\n# Inside the container, after startup completes\ndocker exec -it ib-gateway bash\nls -la /tmp/.vncpass*\n# Should show: \"No such file or directory\"\n```\n\n**Test 4: Verify x11vnc is running**\n```bash\ndocker exec -it ib-gateway bash\npgrep -a x11vnc\n# Should show x11vnc process with -passwdfile argument\n```\n\n**Test 5: Check for exposed credentials**\n```bash\n# Inside container\ndocker exec -it ib-gateway bash\n# Check process list\nps aux | grep -i password\n# Check proc filesystem\nfind /proc -name cmdline -exec grep -l password {} \\; 2>/dev/null\n# Should NOT find the actual VNC password\n```\n\n**Test 6: Validate error handling**\n```bash\n# Test with invalid password file path (should fail container startup)\ndocker run -e VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD=\"test\" -e TMPDIR=/nonexistent ...\n# Should fail during startup (can't write password file)\n```\n\n**Graceful Shutdown Behavior:**\n\nThe `stop_ibc()` function (lines 14-45 of run.sh) handles container shutdown:\n\n```bash\nstop_ibc() {\n\techo \".> 😘 Received SIGINT or SIGTERM. Shutting down IB Gateway.\"\n\n\tif pgrep x11vnc >/dev/null; then\n\t\techo \".> Stopping x11vnc.\"\n\t\tpkill x11vnc\n\tfi\n\t# ... continues with other cleanup\n}\n```\n\n**VNC cleanup during shutdown:**\n1. Check if x11vnc is running with `pgrep x11vnc`\n2. If running, kill it with `pkill x11vnc`\n3. The temporary password file was already deleted during startup\n4. No additional cleanup needed for the fix\n\n**Note**: Our fix doesn't change shutdown behavior. The temporary password file is already long gone by the time the container shuts down.\n\n### What Needs to Change: Implementation Details\n\n**Exact Code Changes Required:**\n\nAll three copies of `run.sh` need identical modifications. The `start_vnc()` function must be updated:\n\n**File Locations:**\n- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/stable/scripts/run.sh` (lines 56-66)\n- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/latest/scripts/run.sh` (lines 56-66)\n- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/image-files/scripts/run.sh` (lines 56-66)\n\n**Current Implementation (lines 56-66):**\n```bash\nstart_vnc() {\n\t# start VNC server\n\tfile_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\tif [ -n \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" ]; then\n\t\techo \".> Starting VNC server\"\n\t\tx11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" &\n\t\tunset_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\telse\n\t\techo \".> VNC server disabled\"\n\tfi\n}\n```\n\n**Required Implementation:**\n```bash\nstart_vnc() {\n\t# start VNC server\n\tfile_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\tif [ -n \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" ]; then\n\t\techo \".> Starting VNC server\"\n\t\t# Create temporary password file with secure permissions to avoid exposing\n\t\t# the password in the process list (CWE-200: Information Exposure)\n\t\t_vnc_pass_file=\"/tmp/.vncpass.$$\"\n\t\techo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n\t\tchmod 600 \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n\t\t# Use -passwdfile instead of -passwd to prevent credential exposure in ps/proc\n\t\tx11vnc -ncache_cr -display :1 -forever -shared -bg -noipv6 -passwdfile \"$_vnc_pass_file\" &\n\t\t# Give x11vnc time to read the password file before cleanup\n\t\tsleep 1\n\t\t# Clean up temporary password file\n\t\trm -f \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n\t\tunset_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'\n\telse\n\t\techo \".> VNC server disabled\"\n\tfi\n}\n```\n\n**Changes Summary:**\n1. **Line 61** (old): Remove `-passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\"`\n2. **Between 60-61** (new): Add password file creation (4 lines)\n3. **Line 61** (new): Change to `-passwdfile \"$_vnc_pass_file\"`\n4. **After 61** (new): Add cleanup (2 lines: sleep + rm)\n\n**Why These Specific Changes:**\n\n1. **`_vnc_pass_file=\"/tmp/.vncpass.$$\"`**\n   - Uses `$$` (shell PID) to ensure unique filename\n   - Prevents collisions if multiple containers or processes run simultaneously\n   - The `.` prefix makes it a hidden file (reduces accidental visibility)\n\n2. **`echo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\"`**\n   - Simple, atomic file write\n   - Quoted variable prevents word splitting\n   - Output redirection is standard and reliable\n\n3. **`chmod 600 \"$_vnc_pass_file\"`**\n   - `600` = Owner read/write only (no group, no other)\n   - Quoted filename handles edge cases (though our filename is safe)\n   - Executed immediately after creation to minimize exposure window\n\n4. **`-passwdfile \"$_vnc_pass_file\"` instead of `-passwd \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\"`**\n   - x11vnc reads password from file instead of command line\n   - Filename visible in ps, but password content is not\n   - Standard x11vnc feature, well-tested and supported\n\n5. **`sleep 1`**\n   - Ensures x11vnc has time to read password file before deletion\n   - x11vnc uses `-bg` to daemonize, which happens after password read\n   - 1 second is generous (x11vnc typically reads in milliseconds)\n\n6. **`rm -f \"$_vnc_pass_file\"`**\n   - `-f` flag prevents error if file already deleted (idempotency)\n   - Removes ephemeral credential as soon as it's no longer needed\n   - Reduces window of exposure from \"forever\" to \"~1 second\"\n\n**Order of Operations Matters:**\n\n```\n1. file_env 'VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD'      ← Load password (from env or file)\n2. Check if password exists            ← Only proceed if VNC enabled\n3.

The `/tmp` directory in the container is writable by this user, so password file creation will succeed.\n\n#### Network Exposure\n\nVNC server listens on:\n- **Port 5900** - Exposed by docker-compose.yml mapping `\"127.0.0.1:5900:5900\"`\n- **Bound to 0.0.0.0** inside container (x11vnc default)\n- **Limited to localhost** on Docker host (127.0.0.1 mapping)\n\nThe docker-compose.yml restricts VNC to localhost connections only:\n```yaml\nports:\n  - \"127.0.0.1:5900:5900\"\n```\n\nThis means VNC is not exposed to the network, only to the Docker host machine. However, if users change this to `\"5900:5900\"`, VNC becomes network-accessible, making credential exposure even more critical.\n\n#### Shellcheck Validation\n\nAll three run.sh files should pass shellcheck after the fix:\n```bash\nshellcheck -x stable/scripts/run.sh\nshellcheck -x latest/scripts/run.sh\nshellcheck -x image-files/scripts/run.sh\n```\n\nExpected result: No errors, no warnings.\n\nPotential shellcheck notes:\n- SC2086 (word splitting): Intentional for x11vnc options (if any)\n- SC2064 (expanding variables in trap): Not applicable here\n- SC2046 (quote to prevent word splitting): All our variables are quoted where needed\n\n#### Related Security Improvements in This Codebase\n\nThis fix follows recent security enhancements:\n\n1. **h-fix-command-injection-ssh** (completed 2025-10-14):\n   - Fixed CWE-78 command injection in run_ssh.sh\n   - Removed unsafe `bash -c` wrapper with unquoted variables\n   - CVSS 9.1 Critical vulnerability\n\n2. **h-fix-missing-error-handling** (completed 2025-10-14):\n   - Added `set -Eeo pipefail` to common.sh\n   - Prevents silent configuration failures\n   - Ensures credential file chmod failures halt startup\n\nOur VNC password fix complements these improvements:\n- Like the SSH fix, it addresses credential exposure\n- Like the error handling fix, it follows fail-fast principles\n- Together, they demonstrate a comprehensive security review\n\n#### VNC Security Best Practices (Beyond This Fix)\n\nWhile this fix addresses command-line exposure, additional VNC security measures include:\n\n1. **Use SSH tunneling** instead of direct VNC:\n   ```bash\n   ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 user@docker-host\n   vncviewer localhost:5900\n   ```\n\n2. **Strong VNC passwords**: Enforce minimum length/complexity\n\n3. **Disable VNC in production**: Only enable for development/debugging\n\n4. **Monitor VNC connections**: Log successful/failed VNC authentication attempts\n\n5. **Use VNC over SSL/TLS**: Some VNC servers support encrypted connections (x11vnc has `-ssl` option)\n\nHowever, these are operational concerns beyond the scope of this code fix. Our fix ensures that whatever password is used, it's not leaked through the process list.\n\n## Work Log\n- [2025-10-14] Task created from code review findings\n- [2025-10-14] Context manifest created by context-gathering agent: Added comprehensive analysis of VNC architecture, credential exposure vulnerability (CWE-200), secure password file handling with -passwdfile, comparison with existing credential patterns, error handling analysis, detailed implementation guide, and testing approach"

This feature allows users to remotely view and interact with the IB Gateway GUI through a VNC client. VNC is **only available for the ib-gateway image** - the TWS (Trader Workstation) image uses RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) instead for remote GUI access.\n    55→\n    56→**The Critical Security Issue:**\n    57→\n    58→Currently, when the VNC server starts, the password is passed directly on the x11vnc command line using the `-passwd` option. This makes the password visible to any user on the system via `ps aux`, `/proc` filesystem, or process monitoring tools.

The password is loaded into x11vnc's internal memory\n   205→3. x11vnc doesn't need the file to exist after startup\n   206→4. Even if the file is deleted, x11vnc continues running with the password in memory\n   207→5.

Let's look at the established pattern in `apply_settings()` from `common.sh`:\n   243→\n   244→```bash\n   245→apply_settings() {\n   246→\t# Line 11: Use TWS_PASSWORD in template substitution\n   247→\tfile_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'\n   248→\tenvsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"\n   249→\tunset_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'\n   250→\t# Line 16: Secure the file containing credentials\n   251→\tchmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"\n   252→\t...\n   253→}\n   254→```\n   255→\n   256→**The pattern:**\n   257→1. Load credential with `file_env()` (supports Docker secrets)\n   258→2. Write to a file during configuration\n   259→3. Immediately `chmod 600` to restrict access\n   260→4. Clear from environment with `unset_env()`\n   261→\n   262→**Our VNC fix follows the same security philosophy:**\n   263→1. Load credential with `file_env()` ✓ (already done)\n   264→2. Write to a temporary file ✓ (new: temporary password file)\n   265→3. Secure the file with `chmod 600` ✓ (new)\n   266→4. Use the file instead of command-line argument ✓ (new: -passwdfile)\n   267→5. Delete the temporary file ✓ (new: rm after x11vnc reads it)\n   268→6. Clear from environment with `unset_env()` ✓ (already done)\n   269→\n   270→**Error Handling and Edge Cases:**\n   271→\n   272→The current implementation uses `set -Eeo pipefail` (line 5 of run.sh), which means any command failure will halt the script. However, there are some edge cases to consider:\n   273→\n   274→**Edge Case 1: What if x11vnc fails to start?**\n   275→\n   276→Current code:\n   277→```bash\n   278→x11vnc ... -passwdfile \"$_vnc_pass_file\" &\n   279→sleep 1\n   280→rm -f \"$_vnc_pass_file\"\n   281→```\n   282→\n   283→If x11vnc fails immediately (bad options, display :1 not available, etc.), the `&` backgrounds it, so the script continues. The `sleep 1` ensures we don't delete the file before x11vnc tries to read it. The `rm -f` uses `-f` flag, so it won't fail if the file is already gone.\n   284→\n   285→**Analysis**: The current error handling is adequate because:\n   286→- If x11vnc fails, the container will still start (VNC is optional)\n   287→- The password file gets cleaned up regardless\n   288→- Users will notice VNC isn't working and can check logs\n   289→\n   290→**Edge Case 2: What if /tmp is not writable?**\n   291→\n   292→If `/tmp` is not writable, the `echo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\"` will fail. With `set -e` enabled, this will halt the container startup.\n   293→\n   294→**Analysis**: This is correct behavior because:\n   295→- If `/tmp` is not writable, the container is misconfigured\n   296→- It's better to fail loudly than start in a broken state\n   297→- This follows the \"fail fast\" principle\n   298→\n   299→**Edge Case 3: What if file creation succeeds but chmod fails?**\n   300→\n   301→If `chmod 600` fails (which is extremely rare), the password file exists with default permissions (likely 644, world-readable).\n   302→\n   303→**Analysis**: With `set -e`, the script will halt if `chmod` fails, preventing x11vnc from starting with an insecurely-permissioned password file. This is the correct behavior.\n   304→\n   305→**Edge Case 4: Race condition - could another process read the file?**\n   306→\n   307→Between file creation and `chmod 600`, there's a microsecond window where the file might have default permissions.\n   308→\n   309→**Mitigation**: Use `umask` before file creation:\n   310→```bash\n   311→(umask 077; echo \"$VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\" > \"$_vnc_pass_file\")\n   312→```\n   313→\n   314→However, this is likely overkill for a single-user container context where:\n   315→- The container runs as a non-root user (ibgateway, UID 1000)\n   316→- There are no other users in the container\n   317→- `/tmp` is not shared with the host by default\n   318→\n   319→**Recommendation**: Keep it simple with current approach. The `chmod 600` immediately after file creation is sufficient.\n   320→\n   321→**Edge Case 5: What if x11vnc doesn't finish reading the file before rm?**\n   322→\n   323→The `sleep 1` provides x11vnc time to:\n   324→1. Daemonize (due to `-bg` flag)\n   325→2. Open the password file\n   326→3. Read the password\n   327→4. Close the file\n   328→\n   329→One second is more than sufficient. x11vnc reads the password file synchronously during startup, typically in milliseconds. The `-bg` backgrounding happens after password validation.\n   330→\n   331→**Testing Approach: How to Verify the Fix**\n   332→\n   333→After applying the fix, verification requires:\n   334→\n   335→**Test 1: Password not visible in process list**\n   336→```bash\n   337→# Inside the container\n   338→docker exec -it ib-gateway bash\n   339→ps aux | grep x11vnc\n   340→# Should show: -passwdfile /tmp/.vncpass.[PID]\n   341→# Should NOT show: -passwd [actual password]\n   342→```\n   343→\n   344→**Test 2: VNC connection still works**\n   345→```bash\n   346→# From client machine\n   347→vncviewer localhost:5900\n   348→# Enter the VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD\n   349→# Should successfully connect to IB Gateway GUI\n   350→```\n   351→\n   352→**Test 3: Temporary file is cleaned up**\n   353→```bash\n   354→# Inside the container, after startup completes\n   355→docker exec -it ib-gateway bash\n   356→ls -la /tmp/.vncpass*\n   357→# Should show: \"No such file or directory\"\n   358→```\n   359→\n   360→**Test 4: Verify x11vnc is running**\n   361→```bash\n   362→docker exec -it ib-gateway bash\n   363→pgrep -a x11vnc\n   364→# Should show x11vnc process with -passwdfile argument\n   365→```\n   366→\n   367→**Test 5: Check for exposed credentials**\n   368→```bash\n   369→# Inside container\n   370→docker exec -it ib-gateway bash\n   371→# Check process list\n   372→ps aux | grep -i password\n   373→# Check proc filesystem\n   374→find /proc -name cmdline -exec grep -l password {} \\; 2>/dev/null\n   375→# Should NOT find the actual VNC password\n   376→```\n   377→\n   378→**Test 6: Validate error handling**\n   379→```bash\n   380→# Test with invalid password file path (should fail container startup)\n   381→docker run -e VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD=\"test\" -e TMPDIR=/nonexistent ...\n   382→# Should fail during startup (can't write password file)\n   383→```\n   384→\n   385→**Graceful Shutdown Behavior:**\n   386→\n   387→The `stop_ibc()` function (lines 14-45 of run.sh) handles container shutdown:\n   388→\n   389→```bash\n   390→stop_ibc() {\n   391→\techo \".> 😘 Received SIGINT or SIGTERM.
