          "new_string": "## User Notes\nThis is critical because silent failures in configuration can lead to security misconfigurations (wrong ports, missing credentials, etc.). The fix is simple but important.\n\n## Context Manifest\n\n### How Container Startup and Configuration Currently Works\n\nThis IB Gateway Docker container orchestrates the startup of Interactive Brokers Gateway or TWS (Trader Workstation) in a completely automated fashion within Docker. The container must configure sensitive trading credentials, set up network ports, apply Java VM settings, and optionally establish SSH tunnels - all without user interaction. The reliability of this startup sequence is absolutely critical because any silent failure in configuration could result in the container appearing to start successfully while being misconfigured in ways that compromise security or functionality.\n\n**The Startup Flow:**\n\nWhen the container starts, it executes either `stable/scripts/run.sh` (for IB Gateway) or `stable/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh` (for TWS). Both of these main entry point scripts begin with strict error handling on line 5: `set -Eeo pipefail`. This bash directive enables three critical behaviors:\n\n1. **`-e`**: Exit immediately if any command returns non-zero status\n2. **`-E`**: Ensure that ERR traps are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and subshells\n3. **`-o pipefail`**: Cause a pipeline to return the exit status of the rightmost command that failed, rather than always returning success\n\nOn line 12 of both scripts, they source the common.sh library: `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`. This is where the problem emerges. The run.sh/run_tws.sh scripts have strict error handling enabled, but when they source common.sh, that library does NOT have `set -Eeo pipefail` at the top. This creates a dangerous execution context gap.\n\n**What common.sh Does (And Why Failures Matter):**\n\nThe common.sh library (found in `stable/scripts/common.sh`, `latest/scripts/common.sh`, and `image-files/scripts/common.sh`) contains eight critical functions that configure the entire container environment:\n\n1. **`apply_settings()` (lines 4-39)**: This function applies environment variables into IBC's config.ini and TWS's jts.ini files. It performs several file operations that can fail:\n   - Line 11: `envsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"` - Template substitution that writes credentials (TWS_PASSWORD) to config.ini. If this fails due to missing template file or write permissions, the container would start with no IBC configuration.\n   - Line 14: `chmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"` - Sets config.ini to be readable only by user (security requirement for credentials). Failure here leaves credentials exposed.\n   - Line 23: `mkdir \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"` - Creates settings directory if needed. Failure means settings cannot be persisted.\n   - Line 32: `envsubst <\"${TWS_PATH}/${TWS_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${_JTS_PATH}/${TWS_INI}\"` - Creates jts.ini with timezone configuration. Failure results in wrong timezone or missing configuration.\n\n2. **`file_env()` (lines 45-61)**: Implements Docker secrets support by reading credentials from files (e.g., TWS_PASSWORD_FILE). This function has an explicit exit on line 51: `exit 1` if both the direct environment variable AND the file variable are set (conflicting configuration). This exit SHOULD cause the container to stop, but without strict error handling in common.sh, other failures in this function could be silenced.\n\n3. **`set_ports()` (lines 73-113)**: Determines API_PORT and SOCAT_PORT based on TRADING_MODE (paper vs live) and GATEWAY_OR_TWS setting. This function has explicit exits on lines 91 and 107 for invalid TRADING_MODE values. Port misconfiguration is catastrophic - the container appears to run but applications cannot connect to the API, or worse, connect to the wrong trading mode (paper vs live).\n\n4. **`set_java_heap()` (lines 115-125)**: Modifies JVM settings using sed on line 120: `sed -i \"${_string}\" \"${_vmpath}/ibgateway.vmoptions\"`. If this sed command fails (file not found, permissions issue), the Gateway might start with insufficient memory and crash during operation.\n\n5. **`setup_ssh()` (lines 150-196)**: Prepares SSH tunnel configuration if SSH_TUNNEL is enabled. This function:\n   - Calls `file_env 'SSH_PASSPHRASE'` (line 165) to load SSH key passphrase from Docker secrets\n   - Starts ssh-agent (line 171): `ssh-agent >\"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"`\n   - Sources the agent environment file (line 172): `source \"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"`\n   - Adds SSH keys to agent (line 186): `SSHPASS=\"${SSH_PASSPHRASE}\" sshpass -e -P \"passphrase\" ssh-add`\n\n   Any failure in ssh-agent startup or key loading would leave the SSH tunnel non-functional. The container would appear to start successfully, but SSH tunnel features would silently fail.\n\n6. **`start_ssh()` (lines 198-232)**: Launches the SSH tunnel by executing `\"${SCRIPT_PATH}/run_ssh.sh\" &` (line 231). The run_ssh.sh script creates reverse SSH tunnels to expose the IB Gateway API on a remote server. This is critical for secure remote trading operations.\n\n7. **`start_socat()` (lines 234-249)**: Launches socat which relays TCP connections from 0.0.0.0:4003/4004 to 127.0.0.1:4001/4002 (the IB Gateway API). Line 238 checks if SOCAT_PORT is set and explicitly exits if not: `exit 1`. This exit SHOULD stop the container but could be missed without proper error handling.\n\n8. **`port_forwarding()` (lines 127-148)**: Orchestrates the startup of either SSH tunnel or socat (or both if SSH_TUNNEL=both). Line 132 explicitly exits if API_PORT is not set.\n\n**The Critical Gap - Why Missing set -Eeo pipefail is Dangerous:**\n\nCurrently, common.sh is executed in the error-handling context it inherits from the sourcing script. However, bash's error handling behavior with `source` is nuanced. When run.sh sources common.sh:\n\n1. The `-e` flag IS inherited into common.sh functions\n2. BUT individual command failures within functions may not propagate as expected\n3. Commands in pipelines without `-o pipefail` can mask failures\n4. Errors in subshells may not propagate correctly\n\nConsider these specific failure scenarios that could be silently ignored:\n\n**Scenario 1 - envsubst failure in apply_settings():**\n```bash\n# Line 11 in apply_settings()\nenvsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"\n```\nIf IBC_INI_TMPL is missing or envsubst fails, bash might continue execution (depending on context). Without explicit `set -e` at the top of common.sh, the next command `unset_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'` would execute, clearing the password from environment. Then `chmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"` would try to chmod a non-existent or corrupt config file. The container would start, IBC would launch, but it would have no valid configuration - leading to unpredictable behavior.\n\n**Scenario 2 - mkdir failure in apply_settings():**\n```bash\n# Line 23\nmkdir \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n```\nIf mkdir fails (permissions issue, disk full, parent doesn't exist), the script continues. Line 32 then tries to write to `${_JTS_PATH}/${TWS_INI}` which may fail, but the error might be silenced. The container appears healthy but settings are not persisted.\n\n**Scenario 3 - sed failure in set_java_heap():**\n```bash\n# Line 120\nsed -i \"${_string}\" \"${_vmpath}/ibgateway.vmoptions\"\n```\nIf the vmoptions file doesn't exist or is read-only, sed fails but the function returns success. Gateway starts with default 768MB heap, which may be insufficient for the user's configured JAVA_HEAP_SIZE. Under heavy load, Gateway crashes with OutOfMemoryError.\n\n**Scenario 4 - ssh-agent failure in setup_ssh():**\n```bash\n# Line 171-172\nssh-agent >\"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"\nsource \"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"\n```\nIf ssh-agent fails to start or the source fails, SSH_AUTH_SOCK may not be set. Later, when run_ssh.sh tries to use the agent, it fails. The SSH tunnel never establishes, but the container appears running. Remote trading operations fail cryptically.\n\n**Why These Failures Are Security-Critical:**\n\nThis container manages access to real Interactive Brokers trading accounts with real money. Silent configuration failures can lead to:\n\n1. **Credential exposure**: If `chmod 600` fails, config.ini containing TWS_PASSWORD remains world-readable\n2. **Wrong trading mode**: If set_ports() fails to properly configure ports, application might connect to live account when expecting paper trading, or vice versa\n3. **Disabled security features**: If SSH tunnel setup fails silently, the container exposes raw TCP API on the network instead of through secure SSH tunnel\n4. **Misconfigured authentication**: If apply_settings() fails to write IBC config, the Gateway might start in unexpected authentication state\n\n**The Established Pattern in This Codebase:**\n\nLooking at all other scripts in the codebase, there's a clear and consistent pattern (from grep results showing `set -` usage):\n\n- `stable/scripts/run.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `stable/scripts/run_ssh.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n- `stable/scripts/run_socat.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n- `stable/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `stable/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:3` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `latest/scripts/run.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `latest/scripts/run_ssh.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n- `latest/scripts/run_socat.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n- `latest/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `latest/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:3` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `image-files/scripts/run.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `image-files/scripts/run_ssh.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n- `image-files/scripts/run_socat.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n- `image-files/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `image-files/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:3` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n- `update.sh:2` → `set -Eeuo pipefail`\n\nNotice that:\n- Most scripts use `-Eeo pipefail` (run.sh, run_tws.sh, start_session.sh)\n- Background worker scripts use `-Eo pipefail` (run_ssh.sh, run_socat.sh) - they omit `-u` because they may use unset variables intentionally\n- **common.sh is the ONLY sourced script library that lacks error handling**\n\nThe pattern shows that even scripts that run in background (run_ssh.sh, run_socat.sh) have strict error handling. This is because they run in infinite loops and need to handle errors gracefully, but they should still fail fast on unrecoverable errors.\n\n**The Variation: `-Eeo pipefail` vs `-Eo pipefail`**\n\nLooking at the codebase pattern:\n- Main entry point scripts use `-Eeo pipefail` (includes `-e` which exits on any error)\n- Background worker scripts use `-Eo pipefail` (omits `-e`, handles errors via the while loop logic)\n\nFor common.sh, we should use `-Eeo pipefail` because:\n1. It's a library of functions called during startup, not a background worker\n2. Any function failure should halt the startup process\n3. It matches the pattern of the scripts that source it (run.sh, run_tws.sh)\n\n### What This Fix Requires: Adding Bash Strict Mode to common.sh\n\nThe fix is straightforward: add `set -Eeo pipefail` immediately after the shebang and shellcheck directives in all three copies of common.sh. This ensures that any command failure in the configuration functions will immediately halt the container startup, making failures loud and observable rather than silent and cryptic.\n\n**Exact Implementation:**\n\nAll three common.sh files currently have this structure:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n\napply_settings() {\n```\n\nThey need to become:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n\nset -Eeo pipefail\n\napply_settings() {\n```\n\nThe insertion point is line 3 (after shellcheck directive, before first function definition).\n\n**Why This Position:**\n\n1. **After shebang**: The `#!/bin/bash` on line 1 must come first\n2. **After shellcheck directives**: Line 2 has `# shellcheck disable=SC1091` which tells shellcheck to ignore \"not following source\" warnings. This must come before set commands.\n3. **Before any executable code**: The `set` command must execute before any functions are defined or called\n\n**Testing Considerations:**\n\nAfter adding the error handling, we need to verify:\n\n1. **Normal startup succeeds**: The container should start normally with valid configuration\n2. **Failures are loud**: Intentionally misconfigure environment (e.g., set IBC_INI_TMPL to non-existent file) and verify container exits with error rather than starting in broken state\n3. **Shellcheck still passes**: Run `shellcheck -x stable/scripts/common.sh` to verify no new warnings\n4. **All three copies are updated**: stable/, latest/, and image-files/ directories each have their own copy\n\n**Why We Use `-Eeo pipefail` Not Just `-e`:**\n\n- **`-E`**: Ensures error traps are inherited by functions. If run.sh sets up an ERR trap (it doesn't currently, but might in future), functions in common.sh would inherit it.\n- **`-e`**: Exit immediately on error. Without this, some errors might not stop execution.\n- **`-o pipefail`**: Critical for commands like `envsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"`. Without pipefail, if the input redirection fails, the pipeline still returns success. With pipefail, the failure propagates.\n\n**No Gotchas for This Specific Script:**\n\nSome scripts need to be careful about adding strict error handling because they:\n- Intentionally check if commands fail (e.g., `if ! some_command; then`)\n- Use `|| true` to ignore expected failures\n- Use unset variables intentionally\n\nLooking through common.sh, none of these patterns exist except:\n- Line 183: `if ls \"${HOME}\"/.ssh/id_* >/dev/null; then` - This is fine, the if statement handles the failure case\n- Line 199: `if [ -n \"$(pgrep -f ...)\" ]; then` - Also fine\n- Line 203: `elif ! pgrep ssh-agent >/dev/null; then` - Also fine\n- Line 240: `if [ -n \"$(pgrep -f ...)\" ]; then` - Also fine\n\nAll of these are proper conditional checks where failure is an expected path. The `-e` flag does NOT cause problems with if statements - bash is smart enough to know that in `if ! command; then`, the command failure is expected and doesn't trigger the `-e` exit behavior.\n\n**The Explicit Exits in common.sh:**\n\nThe script already has explicit `exit 1` statements in several places:\n- Line 51 (file_env): Exit if both VAR and VAR_FILE are set\n- Line 91, 107 (set_ports): Exit on invalid TRADING_MODE\n- Line 132 (port_forwarding): Exit if API_PORT not set\n- Line 238 (start_socat): Exit if SOCAT_PORT not set\n\nThese explicit exits are GOOD - they make failure conditions clear. Adding `set -e` ensures that OTHER commands that fail but don't have explicit exits will also cause the script to halt.\n\n### Technical Reference Details\n\n#### File Locations\n\nThe three common.sh files that need modification:\n- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/stable/scripts/common.sh`\n- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/latest/scripts/common.sh`\n- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/image-files/scripts/common.sh`\n\n#### Exact Change Required\n\n**Current state (first 3 lines):**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n\n```\n\n**Required state (first 4 lines):**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n\nset -Eeo pipefail\n```\n\n#### Scripts That Source common.sh\n\nThese scripts depend on common.sh and will benefit from the fix:\n- `stable/scripts/run.sh:12` → `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`\n- `stable/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:11` → `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`\n- `stable/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:10` → `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`\n- Same pattern in `latest/` and `image-files/` directories\n\n#### Functions in common.sh and Their Failure Risks\n\n| Function | Lines | Critical Operations | Failure Risk |\n|----------|-------|-------------------|--------------|\n| `apply_settings()` | 4-39 | envsubst, chmod, mkdir | HIGH - credential exposure, missing config |\n| `file_env()` | 45-61 | File reads, variable exports | MEDIUM - credential loading |\n| `unset_env()` | 65-71 | Variable cleanup | LOW - but important for security |\n| `set_ports()` | 73-113 | Port configuration, explicit exits | CRITICAL - wrong trading mode |\n| `set_java_heap()` | 115-125 | sed file modification | MEDIUM - OOM crashes |\n| `port_forwarding()` | 127-148 | Validation, function calls | HIGH - orchestration |\n| `setup_ssh()` | 150-196 | ssh-agent, file_env, ssh-add | HIGH - tunnel security |\n| `start_ssh()` | 198-232 | Process checks, script launch | MEDIUM - tunnel availability |\n| `start_socat()` | 234-249 | Process checks, script launch | MEDIUM - API accessibility |\n\n#### Environment Variables Used by common.sh\n\nThese variables are read by common.sh functions and misconfiguration could cause failures:\n- `CUSTOM_CONFIG` - If set, skips apply_settings()\n- `TWS_PASSWORD`, `TWS_PASSWORD_FILE` - Credentials\n- `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` - Settings directory\n- `TWS_PATH`, `TWS_INI`, `TWS_INI_TMPL` - File paths\n- `IBC_INI`, `IBC_INI_TMPL` - IBC config paths\n- `TRADING_MODE` - paper, live, or both\n- `GATEWAY_OR_TWS` - gateway or tws\n- `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE` - JVM memory\n- `SSH_TUNNEL` - yes, no, or both\n- `SSH_PASSPHRASE`, `SSH_PASSPHRASE_FILE` - SSH credentials\n- `SSH_OPTIONS`, `SSH_ALIVE_INTERVAL`, `SSH_ALIVE_COUNT` - SSH config\n- `API_PORT`, `SOCAT_PORT` - Network ports\n- `SSH_REMOTE_PORT`, `SSH_VNC_PORT`, `SSH_RDP_PORT` - Tunnel ports\n- `SCRIPT_PATH` - Path to scripts directory\n\n#### Shellcheck Verification Command\n\nAfter making changes:\n```bash\nshellcheck -x /home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/stable/scripts/common.sh\nshellcheck -x /home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/latest/scripts/common.sh\nshellcheck -x /home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/image-files/scripts/common.sh\n```\n\nAll three should return no errors or warnings (exit code 0).\n\n## Work Log\n- [2025-10-14] Task created from code review findings\n- [2025-10-14] Context manifest created by context-gathering agent"

The fix is simple but important.\n    34→\n    35→## Context Manifest\n    36→\n    37→### How Container Startup and Configuration Currently Works\n    38→\n    39→This IB Gateway Docker container orchestrates the startup of Interactive Brokers Gateway or TWS (Trader Workstation) in a completely automated fashion within Docker. The container must configure sensitive trading credentials, set up network ports, apply Java VM settings, and optionally establish SSH tunnels - all without user interaction. The reliability of this startup sequence is absolutely critical because any silent failure in configuration could result in the container appearing to start successfully while being misconfigured in ways that compromise security or functionality.\n    40→\n    41→**The Startup Flow:**\n    42→\n    43→When the container starts, it executes either `stable/scripts/run.sh` (for IB Gateway) or `stable/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh` (for TWS). Both of these main entry point scripts begin with strict error handling on line 5: `set -Eeo pipefail`. This bash directive enables three critical behaviors:\n    44→\n    45→1. **`-e`**: Exit immediately if any command returns non-zero status\n    46→2. **`-E`**: Ensure that ERR traps are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and subshells\n    47→3. **`-o pipefail`**: Cause a pipeline to return the exit status of the rightmost command that failed, rather than always returning success\n    48→\n    49→On line 12 of both scripts, they source the common.sh library: `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`. This is where the problem emerges. The run.sh/run_tws.sh scripts have strict error handling enabled, but when they source common.sh, that library does NOT have `set -Eeo pipefail` at the top. This creates a dangerous execution context gap.\n    50→\n    51→**What common.sh Does (And Why Failures Matter):**\n    52→\n    53→The common.sh library (found in `stable/scripts/common.sh`, `latest/scripts/common.sh`, and `image-files/scripts/common.sh`) contains eight critical functions that configure the entire container environment:\n    54→\n    55→1. **`apply_settings()` (lines 4-39)**: This function applies environment variables into IBC's config.ini and TWS's jts.ini files. It performs several file operations that can fail:\n    56→   - Line 11: `envsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"` - Template substitution that writes credentials (TWS_PASSWORD) to config.ini. If this fails due to missing template file or write permissions, the container would start with no IBC configuration.\n    57→   - Line 14: `chmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"` - Sets config.ini to be readable only by user (security requirement for credentials). Failure here leaves credentials exposed.\n    58→   - Line 23: `mkdir \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"` - Creates settings directory if needed. Failure means settings cannot be persisted.\n    59→   - Line 32: `envsubst <\"${TWS_PATH}/${TWS_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${_JTS_PATH}/${TWS_INI}\"` - Creates jts.ini with timezone configuration. Failure results in wrong timezone or missing configuration.\n    60→\n    61→2. **`file_env()` (lines 45-61)**: Implements Docker secrets support by reading credentials from files (e.g., TWS_PASSWORD_FILE). This function has an explicit exit on line 51: `exit 1` if both the direct environment variable AND the file variable are set (conflicting configuration). This exit SHOULD cause the container to stop, but without strict error handling in common.sh, other failures in this function could be silenced.\n    62→\n    63→3. **`set_ports()` (lines 73-113)**: Determines API_PORT and SOCAT_PORT based on TRADING_MODE (paper vs live) and GATEWAY_OR_TWS setting. This function has explicit exits on lines 91 and 107 for invalid TRADING_MODE values. Port misconfiguration is catastrophic - the container appears to run but applications cannot connect to the API, or worse, connect to the wrong trading mode (paper vs live).\n    64→\n    65→4. **`set_java_heap()` (lines 115-125)**: Modifies JVM settings using sed on line 120: `sed -i \"${_string}\" \"${_vmpath}/ibgateway.vmoptions\"`. If this sed command fails (file not found, permissions issue), the Gateway might start with insufficient memory and crash during operation.\n    66→\n    67→5. **`setup_ssh()` (lines 150-196)**: Prepares SSH tunnel configuration if SSH_TUNNEL is enabled. This function:\n    68→   - Calls `file_env 'SSH_PASSPHRASE'` (line 165) to load SSH key passphrase from Docker secrets\n    69→   - Starts ssh-agent (line 171): `ssh-agent >\"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"`\n    70→   - Sources the agent environment file (line 172): `source \"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"`\n    71→   - Adds SSH keys to agent (line 186): `SSHPASS=\"${SSH_PASSPHRASE}\" sshpass -e -P \"passphrase\" ssh-add`\n    72→\n    73→   Any failure in ssh-agent startup or key loading would leave the SSH tunnel non-functional. The container would appear to start successfully, but SSH tunnel features would silently fail.\n    74→\n    75→6. **`start_ssh()` (lines 198-232)**: Launches the SSH tunnel by executing `\"${SCRIPT_PATH}/run_ssh.sh\" &` (line 231). The run_ssh.sh script creates reverse SSH tunnels to expose the IB Gateway API on a remote server. This is critical for secure remote trading operations.\n    76→\n    77→7. **`start_socat()` (lines 234-249)**: Launches socat which relays TCP connections from 0.0.0.0:4003/4004 to 127.0.0.1:4001/4002 (the IB Gateway API). Line 238 checks if SOCAT_PORT is set and explicitly exits if not: `exit 1`. This exit SHOULD stop the container but could be missed without proper error handling.\n    78→\n    79→8. **`port_forwarding()` (lines 127-148)**: Orchestrates the startup of either SSH tunnel or socat (or both if SSH_TUNNEL=both). Line 132 explicitly exits if API_PORT is not set.\n    80→\n    81→**The Critical Gap - Why Missing set -Eeo pipefail is Dangerous:**\n    82→\n    83→Currently, common.sh is executed in the error-handling context it inherits from the sourcing script. However, bash's error handling behavior with `source` is nuanced. When run.sh sources common.sh:\n    84→\n    85→1. The `-e` flag IS inherited into common.sh functions\n    86→2. BUT individual command failures within functions may not propagate as expected\n    87→3. Commands in pipelines without `-o pipefail` can mask failures\n    88→4. Errors in subshells may not propagate correctly\n    89→\n    90→Consider these specific failure scenarios that could be silently ignored:\n    91→\n    92→**Scenario 1 - envsubst failure in apply_settings():**\n    93→```bash\n    94→# Line 11 in apply_settings()\n    95→envsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"\n    96→```\n    97→If IBC_INI_TMPL is missing or envsubst fails, bash might continue execution (depending on context). Without explicit `set -e` at the top of common.sh, the next command `unset_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'` would execute, clearing the password from environment. Then `chmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"` would try to chmod a non-existent or corrupt config file. The container would start, IBC would launch, but it would have no valid configuration - leading to unpredictable behavior.\n    98→\n    99→**Scenario 2 - mkdir failure in apply_settings():**\n   100→```bash\n   101→# Line 23\n   102→mkdir \"$TWS_SETTINGS_PATH\"\n   103→```\n   104→If mkdir fails (permissions issue, disk full, parent doesn't exist), the script continues. Line 32 then tries to write to `${_JTS_PATH}/${TWS_INI}` which may fail, but the error might be silenced. The container appears healthy but settings are not persisted.\n   105→\n   106→**Scenario 3 - sed failure in set_java_heap():**\n   107→```bash\n   108→# Line 120\n   109→sed -i \"${_string}\" \"${_vmpath}/ibgateway.vmoptions\"\n   110→```\n   111→If the vmoptions file doesn't exist or is read-only, sed fails but the function returns success. Gateway starts with default 768MB heap, which may be insufficient for the user's configured JAVA_HEAP_SIZE. Under heavy load, Gateway crashes with OutOfMemoryError.\n   112→\n   113→**Scenario 4 - ssh-agent failure in setup_ssh():**\n   114→```bash\n   115→# Line 171-172\n   116→ssh-agent >\"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"\n   117→source \"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"\n   118→```\n   119→If ssh-agent fails to start or the source fails, SSH_AUTH_SOCK may not be set. Later, when run_ssh.sh tries to use the agent, it fails. The SSH tunnel never establishes, but the container appears running. Remote trading operations fail cryptically.\n   120→\n   121→**Why These Failures Are Security-Critical:**\n   122→\n   123→This container manages access to real Interactive Brokers trading accounts with real money. Silent configuration failures can lead to:\n   124→\n   125→1. **Credential exposure**: If `chmod 600` fails, config.ini containing TWS_PASSWORD remains world-readable\n   126→2. **Wrong trading mode**: If set_ports() fails to properly configure ports, application might connect to live account when expecting paper trading, or vice versa\n   127→3. **Disabled security features**: If SSH tunnel setup fails silently, the container exposes raw TCP API on the network instead of through secure SSH tunnel\n   128→4. **Misconfigured authentication**: If apply_settings() fails to write IBC config, the Gateway might start in unexpected authentication state\n   129→\n   130→**The Established Pattern in This Codebase:**\n   131→\n   132→Looking at all other scripts in the codebase, there's a clear and consistent pattern (from grep results showing `set -` usage):\n   133→\n   134→- `stable/scripts/run.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   135→- `stable/scripts/run_ssh.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n   136→- `stable/scripts/run_socat.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n   137→- `stable/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   138→- `stable/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:3` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   139→- `latest/scripts/run.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   140→- `latest/scripts/run_ssh.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n   141→- `latest/scripts/run_socat.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n   142→- `latest/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   143→- `latest/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:3` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   144→- `image-files/scripts/run.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   145→- `image-files/scripts/run_ssh.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n   146→- `image-files/scripts/run_socat.sh:2` → `set -Eo pipefail`\n   147→- `image-files/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:5` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   148→- `image-files/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:3` → `set -Eeo pipefail`\n   149→- `update.sh:2` → `set -Eeuo pipefail`\n   150→\n   151→Notice that:\n   152→- Most scripts use `-Eeo pipefail` (run.sh, run_tws.sh, start_session.sh)\n   153→- Background worker scripts use `-Eo pipefail` (run_ssh.sh, run_socat.sh) - they omit `-u` because they may use unset variables intentionally\n   154→- **common.sh is the ONLY sourced script library that lacks error handling**\n   155→\n   156→The pattern shows that even scripts that run in background (run_ssh.sh, run_socat.sh) have strict error handling. This is because they run in infinite loops and need to handle errors gracefully, but they should still fail fast on unrecoverable errors.\n   157→\n   158→**The Variation: `-Eeo pipefail` vs `-Eo pipefail`**\n   159→\n   160→Looking at the codebase pattern:\n   161→- Main entry point scripts use `-Eeo pipefail` (includes `-e` which exits on any error)\n   162→- Background worker scripts use `-Eo pipefail` (omits `-e`, handles errors via the while loop logic)\n   163→\n   164→For common.sh, we should use `-Eeo pipefail` because:\n   165→1. It's a library of functions called during startup, not a background worker\n   166→2. Any function failure should halt the startup process\n   167→3. It matches the pattern of the scripts that source it (run.sh, run_tws.sh)\n   168→\n   169→### What This Fix Requires: Adding Bash Strict Mode to common.sh\n   170→\n   171→The fix is straightforward: add `set -Eeo pipefail` immediately after the shebang and shellcheck directives in all three copies of common.sh. This ensures that any command failure in the configuration functions will immediately halt the container startup, making failures loud and observable rather than silent and cryptic.\n   172→\n   173→**Exact Implementation:**\n   174→\n   175→All three common.sh files currently have this structure:\n   176→```bash\n   177→#!/bin/bash\n   178→# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n   179→\n   180→apply_settings() {\n   181→```\n   182→\n   183→They need to become:\n   184→```bash\n   185→#!/bin/bash\n   186→# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n   187→\n   188→set -Eeo pipefail\n   189→\n   190→apply_settings() {\n   191→```\n   192→\n   193→The insertion point is line 3 (after shellcheck directive, before first function definition).\n   194→\n   195→**Why This Position:**\n   196→\n   197→1. **After shebang**: The `#!/bin/bash` on line 1 must come first\n   198→2. **After shellcheck directives**: Line 2 has `# shellcheck disable=SC1091` which tells shellcheck to ignore \"not following source\" warnings. This must come before set commands.\n   199→3. **Before any executable code**: The `set` command must execute before any functions are defined or called\n   200→\n   201→**Testing Considerations:**\n   202→\n   203→After adding the error handling, we need to verify:\n   204→\n   205→1. **Normal startup succeeds**: The container should start normally with valid configuration\n   206→2. **Failures are loud**: Intentionally misconfigure environment (e.g., set IBC_INI_TMPL to non-existent file) and verify container exits with error rather than starting in broken state\n   207→3. **Shellcheck still passes**: Run `shellcheck -x stable/scripts/common.sh` to verify no new warnings\n   208→4. **All three copies are updated**: stable/, latest/, and image-files/ directories each have their own copy\n   209→\n   210→**Why We Use `-Eeo pipefail` Not Just `-e`:**\n   211→\n   212→- **`-E`**: Ensures error traps are inherited by functions. If run.sh sets up an ERR trap (it doesn't currently, but might in future), functions in common.sh would inherit it.\n   213→- **`-e`**: Exit immediately on error. Without this, some errors might not stop execution.\n   214→- **`-o pipefail`**: Critical for commands like `envsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"`. Without pipefail, if the input redirection fails, the pipeline still returns success. With pipefail, the failure propagates.\n   215→\n   216→**No Gotchas for This Specific Script:**\n   217→\n   218→Some scripts need to be careful about adding strict error handling because they:\n   219→- Intentionally check if commands fail (e.g., `if ! some_command; then`)\n   220→- Use `|| true` to ignore expected failures\n   221→- Use unset variables intentionally\n   222→\n   223→Looking through common.sh, none of these patterns exist except:\n   224→- Line 183: `if ls \"${HOME}\"/.ssh/id_* >/dev/null; then` - This is fine, the if statement handles the failure case\n   225→- Line 199: `if [ -n \"$(pgrep -f ...)\" ]; then` - Also fine\n   226→- Line 203: `elif ! pgrep ssh-agent >/dev/null; then` - Also fine\n   227→- Line 240: `if [ -n \"$(pgrep -f ...)\" ]; then` - Also fine\n   228→\n   229→All of these are proper conditional checks where failure is an expected path. The `-e` flag does NOT cause problems with if statements - bash is smart enough to know that in `if ! command; then`, the command failure is expected and doesn't trigger the `-e` exit behavior.\n   230→\n   231→**The Explicit Exits in common.sh:**\n   232→\n   233→The script already has explicit `exit 1` statements in several places:\n   234→- Line 51 (file_env): Exit if both VAR and VAR_FILE are set\n   235→- Line 91, 107 (set_ports): Exit on invalid TRADING_MODE\n   236→- Line 132 (port_forwarding): Exit if API_PORT not set\n   237→- Line 238 (start_socat): Exit if SOCAT_PORT not set\n   238→\n   239→These explicit exits are GOOD - they make failure conditions clear. Adding `set -e` ensures that OTHER commands that fail but don't have explicit exits will also cause the script to halt.\n   240→\n   241→### Technical Reference Details\n   242→\n   243→#### File Locations\n   244→\n   245→The three common.sh files that need modification:\n   246→- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/stable/scripts/common.sh`\n   247→- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/latest/scripts/common.sh`\n   248→- `/home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/image-files/scripts/common.sh`\n   249→\n   250→#### Exact Change Required\n   251→\n   252→**Current state (first 3 lines):**\n   253→```bash\n   254→#!/bin/bash\n   255→# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n   256→\n   257→```\n   258→\n   259→**Required state (first 4 lines):**\n   260→```bash\n   261→#!/bin/bash\n   262→# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n   263→\n   264→set -Eeo pipefail\n   265→```\n   266→\n   267→#### Scripts That Source common.sh\n   268→\n   269→These scripts depend on common.sh and will benefit from the fix:\n   270→- `stable/scripts/run.sh:12` → `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`\n   271→- `stable/tws-scripts/run_tws.sh:11` → `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`\n   272→- `stable/tws-scripts/start_session.sh:10` → `source \"${SCRIPT_PATH}/common.sh\"`\n   273→- Same pattern in `latest/` and `image-files/` directories\n   274→\n   275→#### Functions in common.sh and Their Failure Risks\n   276→\n   277→| Function | Lines | Critical Operations | Failure Risk |\n   278→|----------|-------|-------------------|--------------|\n   279→| `apply_settings()` | 4-39 | envsubst, chmod, mkdir | HIGH - credential exposure, missing config |\n   280→| `file_env()` | 45-61 | File reads, variable exports | MEDIUM - credential loading |\n   281→| `unset_env()` | 65-71 | Variable cleanup | LOW - but important for security |\n   282→| `set_ports()` | 73-113 | Port configuration, explicit exits | CRITICAL - wrong trading mode |\n   283→| `set_java_heap()` | 115-125 | sed file modification | MEDIUM - OOM crashes |\n   284→| `port_forwarding()` | 127-148 | Validation, function calls | HIGH - orchestration |\n   285→| `setup_ssh()` | 150-196 | ssh-agent, file_env, ssh-add | HIGH - tunnel security |\n   286→| `start_ssh()` | 198-232 | Process checks, script launch | MEDIUM - tunnel availability |\n   287→| `start_socat()` | 234-249 | Process checks, script launch | MEDIUM - API accessibility |\n   288→\n   289→#### Environment Variables Used by common.sh\n   290→\n   291→These variables are read by common.sh functions and misconfiguration could cause failures:\n   292→- `CUSTOM_CONFIG` - If set, skips apply_settings()\n   293→- `TWS_PASSWORD`, `TWS_PASSWORD_FILE` - Credentials\n   294→- `TWS_SETTINGS_PATH` - Settings directory\n   295→- `TWS_PATH`, `TWS_INI`, `TWS_INI_TMPL` - File paths\n   296→- `IBC_INI`, `IBC_INI_TMPL` - IBC config paths\n   297→- `TRADING_MODE` - paper, live, or both\n   298→- `GATEWAY_OR_TWS` - gateway or tws\n   299→- `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE` - JVM memory\n   300→- `SSH_TUNNEL` - yes, no, or both\n   301→- `SSH_PASSPHRASE`, `SSH_PASSPHRASE_FILE` - SSH credentials\n   302→- `SSH_OPTIONS`, `SSH_ALIVE_INTERVAL`, `SSH_ALIVE_COUNT` - SSH config\n   303→- `API_PORT`, `SOCAT_PORT` - Network ports\n   304→- `SSH_REMOTE_PORT`, `SSH_VNC_PORT`, `SSH_RDP_PORT` - Tunnel ports\n   305→- `SCRIPT_PATH` - Path to scripts directory\n   306→\n   307→#### Shellcheck Verification Command\n   308→\n   309→After making changes:\n   310→```bash\n   311→shellcheck -x /home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/stable/scripts/common.sh\n   312→shellcheck -x /home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/latest/scripts/common.sh\n   313→shellcheck -x /home/pandashark/projects/ib-gateway-docker/image-files/scripts/common.sh\n   314→```\n   315→\n   316→All three should return no errors or warnings (exit code 0).\n   317→\n   318→## Work Log\n   319→- [2025-10-14] Task created from code review findings\n   320→- [2025-10-14] Context manifest created by context-gathering agent\n   321→"

        "text": "## Context Manifest Explanation\n\nLet me break down what the manifest tells us about this task:\n\n---\n\n### **The Problem in Simple Terms**\n\n**What's Wrong:**\nAll the shell scripts in this codebase use strict error handling (`set -Eeo pipefail`) EXCEPT for `common.sh` - the most critical library that handles credentials, ports, SSH tunnels, and Java configuration.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nWithout strict error handling, when something fails in `common.sh`, the script keeps running instead of stopping. This means the container can appear to start successfully while being dangerously misconfigured.\n\n---\n\n### **The Critical Functions at Risk**\n\nThe manifest documents 8 functions in `common.sh` and what happens if they fail silently:\n\n**1. `apply_settings()` - Writes Credentials**\n- Creates config files with trading passwords\n- If `chmod 600` fails → passwords left world-readable\n- If `envsubst` fails → no configuration written, but script continues\n\n**2. `set_ports()` - Determines Trading Mode**\n- Sets ports for paper trading (4001/4002) vs live trading (7496/7497)\n- Silent failure → **connect to wrong trading mode with real money**\n- Explicit `exit 1` on invalid mode, but other errors could be missed\n\n**3. `setup_ssh()` - SSH Tunnel Security**\n- Starts ssh-agent and loads SSH keys\n- If ssh-agent fails silently → SSH tunnels don't work, raw API exposed\n- If key loading fails → can't authenticate to bastion server\n\n**4. `set_java_heap()` - JVM Memory**\n- Modifies Gateway memory settings with `sed`\n- Silent failure → Gateway uses default 768MB, crashes under load with OutOfMemoryError\n\n---\n\n### **Real-World Failure Scenarios**\n\nThe manifest provides 4 detailed scenarios showing exactly how silent failures cause problems:\n\n**Scenario 1: Credential Exposure**\n```bash\nenvsubst <\"${IBC_INI_TMPL}\" >\"${IBC_INI}\"  # Fails (template missing)\n# Without -e, script continues...\nunset_env 'TWS_PASSWORD'                    # Clears password from env\nchmod 600 \"${IBC_INI}\"                      # Tries to secure non-existent file\n# Container starts, IBC has no config, unpredictable behavior\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Wrong Trading Mode**\n```bash\n# set_ports() port calculation fails\n# Container starts with wrong ports\n# Application connects to LIVE account when user expected PAPER trading\n# Real money trades execute by mistake\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: Disabled Security**\n```bash\nssh-agent >\"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"  # Fails to start\nsource \"${HOME}/.ssh-agent.env\"       # Sources empty/broken file\n# SSH_AUTH_SOCK not set, tunnel setup fails\n# Container exposes raw TCP API on network instead of through secure SSH tunnel\n```\n\n---\n\n### **The Established Pattern**\n\nThe manifest shows that **16 other scripts** already use strict error handling:\n- `run.sh`, `run_tws.sh`, `start_session.sh` → `-Eeo pipefail`\n- `run_ssh.sh`, `run_socat.sh` → `-Eo pipefail` (background workers)\n- Even `update.sh` → `-Eeuo pipefail`\n\n**common.sh is the only exception** - and it's sourced by all the main scripts, creating an error-handling gap.\n\n---\n\n### **What Each Flag Does**\n\nThe manifest explains why we need all three flags in `-Eeo pipefail`:\n\n**`-E`**: Error traps inherit to functions\n- Ensures if run.sh sets an ERR trap, functions in common.sh inherit it\n\n**`-e`**: Exit immediately on error\n- Any command that returns non-zero stops the script\n- **BUT** it's smart: doesn't exit for `if ! command` where failure is expected\n\n**`-o pipefail`**: Pipeline failure detection\n- Without this: `envsubst <missing.file >output.ini` returns success (exit 0)\n- With this: The input redirection failure causes pipeline to fail\n\n---\n\n### **The Fix (Simple)**\n\nAdd one line to 3 files:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# shellcheck disable=SC1091\n\nset -Eeo pipefail  # <-- ADD THIS LINE\n\napply_settings() {\n```\n\n**Files to modify:**\n1. `stable/scripts/common.sh`\n2. `latest/scripts/common.sh`  \n3. `image-files/scripts/common.sh`\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Fix Is Safe**\n\nThe manifest analyzed the existing code and found:\n- ✓ All error handling is already via `if` statements (which work fine with `-e`)\n- ✓ No intentional `|| true` patterns that rely on silent failures\n- ✓ Already has explicit `exit 1` in critical places\n- ✓ No unset variable usage that would conflict with strict mode\n\n**No gotchas** - this is a straightforward safety improvement.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Critical for Trading**\n\nThis container controls **real Interactive Brokers trading accounts with real money**:\n- Silent configuration failures could expose credentials\n- Wrong port configuration could connect to wrong trading mode (paper vs live)\n- SSH tunnel failures could disable security features\n- Java heap failures could crash during active trading\n\n**Fail-fast is better than fail-silent** - we want loud errors at startup, not subtle runtime failures.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe manifest thoroughly documents:\n1. **What common.sh does** - 8 critical configuration functions\n2. **What can go wrong** - 4 specific failure scenarios with security impact\n3. **Why it's inconsistent** - All other scripts have strict error handling\n4. **How to fix it** - Add one line in 3 files\n5. **Why it's safe** - Code analysis shows no conflicts\n\nIt's a comprehensive blueprint for understanding not just WHAT to change, but WHY it matters and HOW the system works."
